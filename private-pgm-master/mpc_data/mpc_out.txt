Significant amount of unused dabits of replicated Z2^64 distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 0.0118935 seconds
Data sent = 0.177704 MB in ~150 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 0.53292 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
        program.use_trunc_pr = True
        program.use_split(3)
